🚀 File Organizer

**File Organizer** is a Python-based file system automation utility engineered to intelligently classify, structure, and reorganize unstructured directories using extension-based categorization.

The system leverages Python’s OS-level abstractions to perform deterministic file analysis, dynamic directory provisioning, and safe relocation of assets — improving digital workspace maintainability and operational efficiency.

This project demonstrates practical automation engineering, clean architecture principles, and structured repository management using Git.

🧠 Problem Context
Unstructured directories (e.g., Downloads, Desktop) frequently accumulate heterogeneous file types, leading to:
- Increased retrieval latency  
- Reduced productivity  
- Poor directory hygiene  
- Manual file maintenance overhead  
This tool programmatically enforces a deterministic folder hierarchy to eliminate clutter and optimize file discoverability.

🧩 Engineering Decisions

🔹 Deterministic Mapping Strategy

A dictionary-based extension mapping ensures O(1) lookup time for file categorization.

🔹 Dynamic Directory Provisioning

os.makedirs() safely creates folders without raising redundant exceptions.

🔹 Atomic File Movement

shutil.move() provides reliable file relocation with underlying OS-level handling.

🔹 Scalability Considerations

The architecture allows easy:

• Addition of new categories

• Integration of CLI arguments

• Logging integration

• GUI extension

📈 Performance Characteristics

•Time Complexity: O(n), where n = number of files

•Space Complexity: O(1) auxiliary space

•Efficient for small to medium-sized directories
